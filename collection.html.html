<p class="para">A spectral, slow-moving procession of milky-eyed, glam zombies filed toward a ritual ring of salt at the end of the Art School show. “The idea was that they were queer deities, archangels, witches,” said designer Eden Loweth. “We always want to present our models as if they are Naomi Campbell, but this season we wanted to echelon them even higher. This season we cast more transpeople than ever before, and we wanted to show each one, give them a voice.”

Loweth and codesigner Tom Barratt said they meant to “cut through the performance” this time, but they still managed to stir up theatrical sensations of otherworldly angst using minimal devices. Barratt, who walked—or rather, deliberately staggered—in kitten heels and a strapless dress, is a member the PlayStation generation who formed an affectionate fascination for plunging through Silent Hill, the Japanese horror game launched in the 2000s. “I think Silent Hill speaks a lot to the world today,” said Barratt. “For queer people it can often be a battle and scary, mentally intense and almost dystopian.”

Thus, the repulsion of the pupil-less contact lenses, the instructions to participants to slow down the pace, and the fact that Loweth’s childhood singer-songwriter idol, Anna Calvi, was playing her guitar live at the end of the runway, standing in the ritualistic circle of salt.

For all the creepsome emotional atmosphere, the staging was also a deliberately courageous act to cut out frenetic action and slow it down so that critical audience gaze had to linger on every individual and their look—the long silver shimmery coin-pailletted gowns, the button-through “nurse” dresses, the tight leopard-spotted painted leather cocktail minis, and the cut of the brown Lurex tailoring. It paid off: The collection was very together, well-edited, and as punctuated with tailoring (like sober jackets minimally knife-slashed in the back) as it was with sparkly party gowns.

Loweth and Barratt are a highly responsible pair who nurture and represent the nonbinary community of all ages and shapes in London through the public space of fashion shows. “We are voices for this community—that was bestowed on us; we didn’t seek it,” said Barratt. “But this is our work. We don’t constantly tweet about it—we’re too busy making.” Simultaneously, the designers also have a responsibility to each other and their employees to show they can improve their fabrics, quality, and focus of their collection, and that they are seriously motivated to be a credible fashion-making company rather than creators of costumes and performance organizers.

Nevertheless, their expertise in fitting trans bodies is a market opportunity in itself, Loweth says, picking out the example of bustier tops “which are cut on the bias, so a trans body can be comfortable.” The designers have also worked out grading systems in which an identical dress can be cut to fit a man or a woman—or whatever the customer identifies with in between.</P>

<P class="art2p">The nature of art and related concepts, such as creativity and interpretation, are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics.[9] The resulting artworks are studied in the professional fields of art criticism and the history of art.</P>
<div class="border"></div>

<p class="par">The nature of art has been described by philosopher Richard Wollheim as "one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture".[20] Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake, and as mimesis or representation. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of Aristotle.[21] Leo Tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.[21] Benedetto Croce and R. G. Collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions, and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator.[22][23] The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of Kant, and was developed in the early 20th century by Roger Fry and Clive Bell. More recently, thinkers influenced by Martin Heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.[24] George Dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as "the art world" has conferred "the status of candidate for appreciation".[25] Larry Shiner has described fine art as "not an essence or a fate but something we have made. Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely two hundred years old."</p>
